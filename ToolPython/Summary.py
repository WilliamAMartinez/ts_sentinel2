
Well, when I am performing the the index vegetaton and getting the time series of it. I will notice changes in the trend becouse the
the initial label may change to other lnd cover, well my analysis will dependent in the dominant land cover in the area.


Well most of the methrics are based in the index vegetation NBR, I expect to find the way of integrate more information from other
bands that can improve the accuraccy of the clasficction

land cover transition may be important to evaluate theqalit of the training, it may change over the time and we will eed to fit it.

variations in pixel values no only obe to natural changes of the vegetation, so fo example, clouds, change in ilumination an undetected haze
 or spirckles may be also reason of change. Thi may impact the final analysis. So this kind of changes need to be adrresed
 fisrt before any characterization of land cover changes

 weell, I found interesteing lines of ndvi for water for example
 the heteregeneity at the begingin of the year make me think in constrint
 the classifier for some seasons.
