# Abstract

Land Use Land Cover (LCLU) is very well established as one of the most efficient approaches for monitoring land cover and its changes (GÂ´omez et al., 2016). Estimating the dynamic of the land cover system under different temporal scales may contribute to improve our understanding of its interaction with different biophysical process according with their temporal variation (Yang et al., 2013). In this thesis, we investigated the viability of producing inter-annual maps by implementing scene-based and pixel-based composites using sentinel 2 imagery, and an automatic labeling procedure for the classification based on old maps. Our results provide initial insights into the benefits and specific issues in this context. We found out that the use of pixel-base composites based on maximization of NDVI can lead to combat cloud contamination and reproduce artificial imagery with good quality for classification. Besides that, the reference old maps resulted in an extensive source of training data that also contain an important fraction of noise. To address this issue, we undertook the viability of using two procedures for refining mislabel data, one based on a iterative learning procedure using Random forest and entropies, and another based in the variability of NDVI signals. The proposed methodologies are tested using Sentinel 2 imagery for 2017 and the reference COS map developed by DGT. From the results, we discussed extensively the robustness of classifiers in the presence of different levels od noise data as well as parametrization in an environment of automatic mapping.
