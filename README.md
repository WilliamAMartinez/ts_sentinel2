# ts_sentinel2 

The purpose of this site is to document the process of analysis in python and R of the intra-annual variability of time series of Sentinel 2 imagery for annual land cover mapping. 

# Documentation
The itegration of land cover transitions in the classification task has let to a better consistency in the discrimination of intra classes that are difficult to seperate using the usual static data perspective. Probably, one drawback in its application has been the lack of dense temporal information that also has high spatial resolution. However, nowadays with the operation of sentinel 2, the research may benefit from the new data available - we never had high spatial resolution images (10 m) with a temporal resolution of 5 days and with an open data policy. 

In this sense, readers can have access to the proposal  and the following documentation:
